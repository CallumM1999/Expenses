### About
This was a simple project for me to work on my front end design skills.

I am very happy with how it turned out, especially with the custom css animations.

### Installation
Initialize package manager
```
yarn
```
Run webpack dev server
```
yarn dev-server
```

Otherwise, you can build the project.
```
yarn build
```
I suggest using live-server to access the webpage
```
live-server public
```
