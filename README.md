### About
This was a simple project to work on front-end development skills.

The app was build with VueJS. In the app, you add different incomes and expenses. The app makes it easier to manage costs, and displays them in a friendly way.

### Installation
Initialize package manager
```
yarn
```
Run webpack dev server
```
yarn dev-server
```

Otherwise, you can build the project.
```
yarn build
```
I suggest using live-server to access the webpage
```
live-server public
```
